### Overview

**Intro**

This project is named Around The U.S

This is the first responsive design project that we have completed here at TripleTen. It involes implementing responsive design to different screen resolutions including desktop and mobile.

This project involved use of html and css just like the first two projects, in addition to html and css we were introduced to FIGMA which is a very handy application when designing webpages. Other skills that were used in this project include grid and media queries.

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
